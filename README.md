# Node.js & MySQL --- Bamazon App

## Overview

This is an Amazon-like storefront with MySQL. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory.

As a bonus task, I will try to program the app to track product sales across the store's departments and then provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.


This app utilizes the following NPM packages for data input and storage:
**MySQL**
**Inquirer**

Please see the following video to see how the application works. It will show how a typical user flows through the application (this is helpful for the customer and/or the relevant manager/supervisor). This includes views of the prompts and the responses after their selection (for the different selection options).
